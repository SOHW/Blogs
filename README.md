## What it is?

SOHW is an open project that seeks to bring forth a culture of openness. Our goal is to have people come forward and share their technical skills with a diverse set of others. This project is designed to guide people who joined the web with a keen interest to update themselves on the current trends by learning or to develop something for the betterment of the web.

*Note: This project is being developed under the Mozilla Open Leadership Program, Round 5 and mentored by [Pranshu Khanna](https://github.com/pransh15). The site was developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with github.

## Why does this project exist?

*	Newcomers always find it difficult and suffer from where to start
*	Lack of information on opportunities available on the web
*	Many advance resource materials are too complex for newcomers to understand
*	Lack of resources at beginner level
*	Donâ€™t know who to approach when in doubt

## What we plan for it?

*	We offer a collection of resources that are free, open and remixable
*	Newcomers can get guidance directly from the author of the resource or with their team easily
*	We help newcomers come out with flying colors
*	Newcomers can collaborate with others that have different technical backgrounds and learn from their knowledge

## How are we doing it?

We are developing a website where volunteers can share resources from their specialized field and newcomers can use these resources to learn. SOHW helps people with different technical backgrounds collaborate. It allows them to find better solutions for problems in this open space. Those who wish to develop a project can find others with a similar goal. Newcomers can join as a volunteer on any open project they find. We are always eager to hear the problems of newcomers and will guide them individually to make them shine in a tech field. 

### Volunteers

If you would like to be a contributor/volunteer, well! It's our pleasure to have you here as a pillar for us. Did you find a lack of resources for certain topics or do you want to edit an existing resource? Do you have something to share with a newcomer? Please have a look at our [contribution guidelines](#participation-guidelines). 

### Newcomers

If you find it difficult to understand a resource at [SOHW](https://sohw.github.io/), feel free to [reach us](#reach-us). We will help you connect with the author/mentor/team directly to clarify your doubts. You can even volunteer to rewrite the content in a simpler way. We welcome you and will be always there for your initial steps towards the tech industry. ðŸ˜Š
